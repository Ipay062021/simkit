## üöÄ What is SimKit?

SimKit is a TypeScript simulation framework designed for testing and running AI agents. It allows you to create custom simulated environments where AI agents can operate. This framework provides a straightforward game loop for step-by-step execution, supports multiple agents, and includes built-in tools to track simulation events through OTEL (OpenTelemetry) logging. With SimKit, you can test your AI agents without restrictions, keeping everything local and in your control.

### üîç Key Features

- **Agent Agnostic:** Work with any AI agent or large language model (LLM).
- **Custom Environments:** Tailor your simulations to meet your specific testing needs.
- **No Vendor Lock-in:** Use your models freely without being tied to a specific platform.
- **Logging Support:** Integrated OTEL logging helps track agent activities during simulations.
